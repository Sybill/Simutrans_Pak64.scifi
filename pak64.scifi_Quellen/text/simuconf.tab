# Max number of steps in goods pathfinding
# This should be equal or greater than the biggest group
# of interconnected stations in your game.
#
# If you set it too low, some goods might not find a route
# if the route is too complex. If you set it too high, the
# search will take a lot of CPU power, particularly if searches
# often fail because there is no route.
#
# Depending on your CPU power, you might want to limit the search
# depth.
#
# 300 seems to be a good compromise for most games. 100 is ok for
# small games. 8000 should suffice for even the largest maps, but
# will take a good amount of CPU time if you have complex transport
# networks. Max. allowed value is 9994.
#
# prissi: On a 512x512 map with more than 150000 people daily, the saturation
# value for "no route" was higher, around 8000. Using 300 instead almost doubled
# the value of "no route"

# 5. I think 6 is a good compromise that allows complex networks but
# cuts off the more extreme cases
#
# You can set this lower to save a little bit of CPU time, but at some
# point this means you'll get less passengers to transport

# This value is less critical than "max_hops" from above.

# T. Kubes: I would say 8 for now, but this definitely should be difficulty
